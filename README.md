# Xe's Wallpapers

I've been getting better at photography and I want to share some of my
best shots with the world. This repository will contain 100% JPEG
original pictures that are converted into 85 quality JPEG and JXL
images for consumption in downstream distributions.

## Installation

TODO: write me after setting up package repos

If you are using Bluefin or Bazzite Linux, you don't need to do
anything to install my photography.
